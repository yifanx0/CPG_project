This file documents observations made during the data cleaning process for the 
CPG project.

# Replicating Previous Data Cleaning Process

This section deals with the process and results of replicating the cleaning code 
provided by Professor Joo in the RA2/data_cleaning directory.

# Exploring Files in the "externals" Directory

This section stores our findings when exploring the files in the "externals" 
directory. It mainly includes our interpretation of the variable names and 
the comparison we make between the private and public data.
