8    PROFIT      Num       8     41   Profit margin =(price-cost)/price

3    WEEK        Num       3     11   Week Number

Notes:
  The Price of purchasing a single unit is PRICE/QTY, 
    also price refers to the net price
  QTY is the number of units the PRICE will buy, for example
    a BOGO @ 2 for $1, if consumers buy 20 units the record will
    be MOVE=20, PRICE=1, QTY=2
  Revenues can be computed as (PRICE/QTY)*MOVE
  PROFIT refers to gross profits margin only,
    if there is a payback from the manufacturer to the retailer
    PROFIT may be adjusted to reflect this payment but only
    during selected weeks and if the payment is directly in
    proportion to the number of units sold.  See payback file
    for more information.  The average wholesale cost can be
    imputed from PROFIT=100*(PRICE-WHOLESALECOST)/PRICE.  Also,
    note that PROFIT is not necessarily the marginal wholesale 
    cost, but comes from Dominick's accounting system which uses
    a LIFO system.
  Gross profits in $ can be computed as PROFIT*(PRICE/QTY)*MOVE
  OK is imputed by a program that scans for irregularities across
    categories, for example if the sales of the store are twice
    what they are usually, and the preceding week has zero sales
    then it is likely that the sales were aggregated together.  This
    will be flagged with OK=0.
  SALE can take the following values:
    B   Bonus-buy
    C   Coupon
    G   ?
    S   ?
    Non-null SALE values denote some type of promotion.
  WEEK refers to Dominick's store week, where WEEK=1 is 9/14/1989-9/20/1989,
    WEEK=2 is 9/21/1989-9/27/1989, etc.  See the data/date.asc file.
    Note that weeks always start with a Thursday and ends on Wednesday.

6    WSTART      Num       8     50   First week UPC is sold in data

Notes:

  The DESCRIP are entered by Dominicks store employees and may include
    many abbreviations that depend upon the brand and product.
  WSTART is often not set
  The complete listing of COM_CODE is given in the data/com_code.txt file.
  For more information about the UPC's from IRI see the data/upcdict file.
    Also, note that UPCs are not necessarily unique through time.  UPCs can
    be reused by a manufacturer.  Usually this is not a problem when looking
    at short time spans (<26 weeks), but for longer periods it is a good idea
    to make sure that there is not a new version # associated with a UPC.
